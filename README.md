# INTRODUCTION
Edge detection is a fundamental process in computer vision and image processing, aimed at identifying significant transitions or boundaries within an image. These boundaries often correspond to changes in intensity, color, texture, or depth, representing the edges of objects or features in a scene. The ability to detect edges is critical for various applications, including object recognition, image segmentation, and scene understanding.

In essence, edge detection transforms raw image data into a structured representation by highlighting areas of interest. This simplification reduces the computational complexity of subsequent processing tasks while preserving essential geometric information.
